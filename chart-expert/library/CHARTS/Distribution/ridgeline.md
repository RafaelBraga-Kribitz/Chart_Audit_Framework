# Ridgeline Plot

## Description
Ridgelines stack partially overlapping density curves so several groups can be compared.

## When to Use
- A data scientist comparing distributions across segments

## When NOT to Use
- An executive score
- More groups than the overlap can bear

## Data Requirements
| Column | Type | Notes |
|--------|------|-------|
| as input type | cat-value, demo-grouped | See `references/input-type-schema.md` |

## Best Practices
- Match the chart to the audience and the surface. A notebook may keep this encoding. An executive page may need a simpler alternative.
- State the comparison (target, prior, peer, or distribution) in the title when the chart is used to communicate.
- Prefer position and length over area and angle when the reader must compare values precisely.

## Common Mistakes
- Hidden baselines
- Densities with different sample sizes and no note


## Dashboard and other surfaces

status: placeholder

`Ridgeline Plot` can sit on a dashboard, in a report, or in a notebook. Executives and clients get it when the comparison is direct. Analysts may still pair it with a diagnostic plot. If the page is only a score, pair it with bar-chart, line-chart, data-table.

Suggested communication placement: **breakdown** zone. Vault coarse type, when a scraped template is the layout: **Line**. Pair it with a second view rather than leaving a lonely number. Analysis placement: a notebook cell or a pandas/matplotlib figure when the audience is technical. Subcategory dashboards that cite this chart are linked from `library/DASHBOARDS/`.


## Implementation Notes

### matplotlib
```python
# Stub. Map columns to the input type cat-value before rendering.
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
fig, ax = plt.subplots()
ax.set_title("Ridgeline Plot")
```

### pandas
A technical audience can stay in a notebook: prepare the frame for `cat-value`, then plot with pandas or matplotlib. Do not assume the same figure is the executive dashboard.

### plotly / altair / excel / tableau
Use the tool's mark that encodes position, area. If the tool defaults to a pie, gauge, or dual axis, switch marks unless that default is truly the question.
