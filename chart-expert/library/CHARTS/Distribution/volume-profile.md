# Volume Profile

## Description
A volume profile is a histogram turned sideways, showing how much activity occurred at each price or level.

## When to Use
- Market or capacity analysis by level

## When NOT to Use
- A time trend

## Data Requirements
| Column | Type | Notes |
|--------|------|-------|
| as input type | xy-simple, cat-value | See `references/input-type-schema.md` |

## Best Practices
- Match the chart to the audience and the surface. A notebook may keep this encoding. An executive page may need a simpler alternative.
- State the comparison (target, prior, peer, or distribution) in the title when the chart is used to communicate.
- Prefer position and length over area and angle when the reader must compare values precisely.

## Common Mistakes
- Reading the tallest bin as a forecast rather than a concentration


## Dashboard and other surfaces

status: placeholder

`Volume Profile` is a valid analysis chart for a data scientist, researcher, R&D, or development notebook (matplotlib, pandas, or plotly). It is a poor primary mark for an executive, HR business-partner, or client page. Communication surface: retell the finding with bar-chart, line-chart, data-table. `ibcs_status: conditional` applies to that communication surface only.

Suggested communication placement: **breakdown** zone. Vault coarse type, when a scraped template is the layout: **Number**. Pair it with a second view rather than leaving a lonely number. Analysis placement: a notebook cell or a pandas/matplotlib figure when the audience is technical. Subcategory dashboards that cite this chart are linked from `library/DASHBOARDS/`.


## Implementation Notes

### matplotlib
```python
# Stub. Map columns to the input type xy-simple before rendering.
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
fig, ax = plt.subplots()
ax.set_title("Volume Profile")
```

### pandas
A technical audience can stay in a notebook: prepare the frame for `xy-simple`, then plot with pandas or matplotlib. Do not assume the same figure is the executive dashboard.

### plotly / altair / excel / tableau
Use the tool's mark that encodes length, position. If the tool defaults to a pie, gauge, or dual axis, switch marks unless that default is truly the question.
